# CS483-Assignment-3



Seed 10 bugs in a simple software for other groups to find.



## Instructions



A random 5-letter word is chosen each time you run the code for the game. You have 6 guesses to guess the word. After each guess, you get feedback on how close your guess was to the secret word.



### Interpreting Feedback



The squares are supposed to be grey, yellow, and green, but they may not appear correctly on some terminals.



The grey (or lightest shade of grey) square means that the letter is not in the word at all.

The yellow (or medium shade of grey) square means that the letter is in the word, but not in that position.

The green (or darkest shade of grey) square means that the letter is in the correct position.



After 6 guesses, the game will be over and the secret word will be revealed.
